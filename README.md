# Designing a Basic Mobile and Web Layout for Zomato – Case Study
1) Applying Gestalt Principles to Enhance Design

Gestalt principles help make the GENZ FOOD FARM – Spice Up logo visually appealing and easy to understand at first glance. Proximity is applied by grouping the flames and chili icons around the central text, reinforcing the theme of heat and spice. Similarity is seen in the consistent use of fiery shapes (flames and chilies), which immediately convey the brand’s identity. Continuity guides the eye smoothly from the top text (“GENZ FOOD FARM”) down through “spice up” to the fire and chili illustrations, creating a natural visual flow. Closure is used through the circular frame, which makes the design feel complete and contained even though the background space is simple. The figure/ground principle is applied with the strong contrast between the light circular background and the orange border, making the text and illustrations stand out clearly as the main focus.

2) Incorporating UI Elements and Design Patterns

For digital use of the GENZ FOOD FARM branding, UI elements can reflect the same theme of spice and warmth. The circular logo can serve as a brand icon in app headers or social media. Consistent button designs (like order or subscribe buttons in red/orange shades with chili or flame icons) will strengthen brand recognition. A card layout for food items can use similar flame and chili motifs, reinforcing the theme visually. On a website or app, a navigation bar could use bold, rounded buttons inspired by the circular logo, while filter chips can be styled with chili icons for quick access to categories like “Mild,” “Medium,” or “Extra Hot.”

3) Developing Interaction Behaviors and Usability Principles

Interaction design for GENZ FOOD FARM should echo the fiery, energetic brand identity. Buttons could provide visual feedback by glowing or showing a flame ripple when tapped. Hover effects on the website could animate chili icons, reinforcing interactivity. Affordances such as raised chili-shaped buttons or glowing flames can signal clickability. Navigation can be kept simple, with a sticky menu bar themed with the brand’s warm colors. Accessibility is supported by ensuring strong color contrast between text and background (like dark brown on cream), providing alt text for flame/chili graphics, and designing large tap targets for mobile users. Smooth animations—such as flames flickering subtly when loading—can further immerse users in the spicy brand experience.
